       <li>Variables - store data types as values</li>
       <li>If statement: a way of introducing decision-making into our code.</li>
       <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal</li>
       <li>Array: a single variable that is used to hold a group of data, [] brackets are used to group data. Each item is assigned an index according to the order in which it is stored in the array starting with "0".</li>
       <li>Const: a constant variable whose value cannot be changed once it's assigned.</li>
       <li>Let: allows us to reassign the value of the variable over time. The 2nd statement is the condition. The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. [x++ is x+1] every time the code loops, x will increase by 1.</li>
       <li>To comment out multiple lines of JavaScript code, put /* before and */ after the block of code. Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it.</li>
       <li>Function: is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file (in our case, script.js) is run. Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it. A function's name is followed by parentheses ().</li>
       <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
       <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
